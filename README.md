# hello-world
Yep.  It's my first repository.
My dad taught me Fortran when I was 15.  I taught myself C when I was 27 because I needed a data checking program to keep us accurate, complete, and brilliant.  C+ was easy.  Php is more like learning a different way of constructing a sentence rather than finding out what a sentence is.  Nothing prepares you for Character Sets though.
